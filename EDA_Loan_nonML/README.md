##Exploratory Data Analysis for the Loan dataset

###Introduction 
In this project I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis for the Loan dataset (mentioned below) and have tried to understand the effect of various factors such as Credit history, past delinquencies, Loan Amount, Employment Status, etc on their Loan payment status. I have used R for this project.

###Installation

Use [this github](https://github.com/varsha-shewale/Projects-Final/tree/master/EDA_Loan) repo to access the data and the R code written by me.

###Changes To-be-done

The Machine Learning model needs to be updated to use Precision and Recall metric instead of Accuracy.
The train-test data split method used should be k-fold cross validation.
Table of contents needs to be added
