##Titanic dataset analysis

###Introduction
In the project I have analyzed the Titanic dataset and have tried to understand the effect of various passengers' demographics on their survival.
I have used Tableau (Public Edition) for Exploratory Data Analysis and Explanatory Data Visualization.

###Installation

Use [this github](https://github.com/varsha-shewale/Projects-Final/tree/master/DataVisTableau_titanic) repo to access the data and the Tableau workbooks created by me.
