Titanic dataset analysis and visualizations using Tableau

Summary
In the Titanic story created, I have explained the various factors that most likely led to an individual’s survival in the titanic tragedy.
My story consists of 4 main visualizations explaining whether there is a relation between an individual’s gender, age, social class, ticket fare, number of companions onboard, etc. and their survival.
