##WeRateDogs Twitter Archive (Data Wrangling)

###Introduction
In this project I conducted Data Wrangling for the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. Additional data needed for this project was obtained from Twitter using the Twitter API using the tweet ID's for each record in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.
The original twitter archive, the additional data obtained using the Twitter API and the dog breed prediction data was merged together to have a final dataset ready for exploratory data analysis.
As the main focus of this project is Data Wrangling, EDA and explanatory data analysis are minimalist in nature to ensure the data wrangled is ready to be used for EDA and further analysis. 


###Installation

Use [this github](https://github.com/varsha-shewale/Projects-Final/tree/master/DataWrangling_weRateDogs) repo to access the data and the jupyter notebook (Python code) written by me.
