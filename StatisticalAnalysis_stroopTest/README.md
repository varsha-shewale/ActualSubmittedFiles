##Statistical Analysis for 'Stroop Test' dataset

###Introduction 
In this project, I have investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task. I analyzed the data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results and accordingly interpreted the results in terms of hypotheses.

###Installation

Use [this github](https://github.com/varsha-shewale/Projects-Final/tree/master/StatisticalAnalysis_stroopTest) repo to access the data and the jupyter nottebook with Python code written by me.
