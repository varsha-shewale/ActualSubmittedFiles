##Statistical Analysis for 'Stroop Test' dataset

###Introduction 
In this project, I have investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
I created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task. I analyzed the data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results and accordingly interpreted the results in terms of hypotheses.

###Installation

Use (this github)[https://github.com/varsha-shewale/Projects-Final/tree/master/EDA_Loan] repo to access the data and the R code written by me.

###Changes To-be-done

The Machine Learning model needs to be updated to use Precision and Recall metric instead of Accuracy.
The train-test data split method used should be k-fold cross validation.
Table of contents needs to be added
